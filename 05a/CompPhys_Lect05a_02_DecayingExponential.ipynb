The values of time to output the solution for.\n","\n","\n","The differential equation is specified by defining a function. This function takes two arguments. The first is the current $y$. The second is $t$. The function must calculate and return $\\frac{d y}{d t}$.\n","\n","The initial condition here is $y(t_0)$, the value of `y` at the initial time. When there are multiple variables later, we use a list, tuple, or array with the right number of elements.\n","\n","For the times, we only need an array of the times. We can sample the solution at very spaced-out times, or very finely. The solver will take whatever steps internally it needs to for an accurate solution, but returns only the asked-for values.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"cae41a13","metadata":{"id":"cae41a13"},"outputs":[],"source":["%matplotlib inline\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","# A new import - scipy's basic ODE integration function\n","from scipy.integrate import odeint"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3d2f9a85","metadata":{"id":"3d2f9a85"},"source":["## Exercise\n","\n","Define the function below for $\\frac{d y}{dt} = - y$ and evaluate the next few cells to check the solution."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"2deff898","metadata":{"id":"2deff898"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Defining the derivative function like this.\n","def deriv1(y, t):\n","    # Edit here to calculate dydt\n","    return dydt"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"17967000","metadata":{"id":"17967000"},"outputs":[],"source":["y_init1 = 1. # Starting value for y, at t = 0"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"668c6e11","metadata":{"id":"668c6e11"},"outputs":[],"source":["# We'll solve from t = 0 to t = 4, at 100 equally-spaced points.\n","times1 = np.linspace(0., 4., 100)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"82459b44","metadata":{"id":"82459b44"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Now evaluate this to solve the equation\n","yarr1 = odeint(deriv1, y_init1, times1)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"8a455e7b","metadata":{"id":"8a455e7b"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Make a plot\n","plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))\n","plt.plot(times1, np.exp(-times1), c='g', label='True solution') # The expected answer - don't modify this\n","plt.scatter(times1, yarr1, s=2, c='k', label='ODE solver')\n","plt.legend()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f9be7654","metadata":{"id":"f9be7654"},"source":["## Exercise\n","\n","What do you need to change to double the amplitude of the solution, i.e. make the solution $2 e^{-t}$ rather than $e^{-t}$?
