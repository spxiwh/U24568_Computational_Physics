We can't do that with a single derivative -- we need a second-order equation.

We've gone from one second-order equation to two first-order equations. Our new variable is the velocity.\n","\n","The main change is in the derivative function. The first argument is now an array of `[y, v_y]`. You can think of this array as 'the state of the world'. It's not just the position, but also the velocity. The function needs to look at that state, and calculate the derivative of each thing.
