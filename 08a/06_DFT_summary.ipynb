    "# Discrete Fourier Transforms - SUMMARY\n",
    "\n",
    "Main points from these exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Fourier transform is a highly useful tool for data analysis. Sometimes features that are not obvious in the time domain, can be clearly seen in the frequency domain.\n",
    "* It is possible to code our own Fourier transform routine, but library codes are *very* fast at doing this. As long as we understand the principles, let's just use the library codes!\n",
    "* Features in the time-domain that are very narrow will be very broad in the frequency domain, and vice-versa. "
