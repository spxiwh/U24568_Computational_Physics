    "# Aliasing Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Aliasing is a problem when discretely sampling data. It can make time-series data at a certain frequency appear at a very different frequency! If possible it is better to sample the data at a higher rate, but this isn't always possible (e.g. streaming music over the internet to someone on dial-up internet). Alternatively you could *remove* the high frequency content (as we will describe in the next notebook), and then downsample the data. If done right, you can *resample* time series, while avoiding aliasing, but is more computationally expensive to do so. This leads in to filtering in our next lecture!"
