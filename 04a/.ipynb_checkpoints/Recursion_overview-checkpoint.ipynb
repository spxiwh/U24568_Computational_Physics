    "# Recursion - Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is an important idea in many computing languages. This basically boils down to \"some function that calls itself\". A standard use case would be where the problem can be repeatedly reduced to a simpler problem of the same form. Some of the examples below might seem more natural using iteration (a for loop or generator), but they're useful practice for building to problems where recursion is more natural. As always, the idea here is to provide you with a toolkit and which tool to use for any given problem is something that should be considered when attempting the problem!\n",

    "As an example of a recursive function (following https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/recursion) let's consider the case of generating X factorial. This can be defined, using a function that calls itself, as follows:"

In this example this wasn't needed (it could have been done as with the previous example, see the commented out code), but in many cases this is the kind of approach that is needed to deal with a recursion problem. Brute-force path-finding is one example where you might want to do something like this."
