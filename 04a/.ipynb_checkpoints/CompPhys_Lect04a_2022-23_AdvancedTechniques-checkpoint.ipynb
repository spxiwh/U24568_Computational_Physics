    "Recursion is an important idea in many computing languages. This basically boils down to \"some function that calls itself\". A standard use case would be where the problem can be repeatedly reduced to a simpler problem of the same form. Some of the examples below might seem more natural using iteration (a for loop or generator), but they're useful practice for building to problems where recursion is more natural. As always, the idea here is to provide you with a toolkit and which tool to use for any given problem is something that should be considered when attempting the problem!\n",
