    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will introduce a number of advanced techniques in Python, which can be useful in a variety of situations. Some of these are particular to Python, and its syntax, others are more general techniques. In particular we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* List, Set and Dictionary comprehensions\n",
    "* Generators\n",
    "* Recursion\n",
    "* Functions as objects, and the Lambda operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Please do ask if you find any of this confusing. We're more than happy to go over this (whether today, or in a future lecture). This topics are largely separate from each other, so you could go over this in whatever order makes sense to you."
