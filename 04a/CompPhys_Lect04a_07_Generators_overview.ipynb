    "# Generators - Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a generator? A generator is a specific type of function in Python, which has some special properties allowing it to be used as an iterator (ie. in a for loop). Let me quote from the nice reference https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/ here:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\n",
    "Introduced with PEP 255, generator functions are a special kind of function that return a lazy iterator. These are objects that you can loop over like a list. However, unlike lists, lazy iterators do not store their contents in memory.\n",
    "\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you need this?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\n",
    "Have you ever had to work with a dataset so large that it overwhelmed your machine’s memory? Or maybe you have a complex function that needs to maintain an internal state every time it’s called, but the function is too small to justify creating its own class. In these cases and more, generators and the Python yield statement are here to help.\n",
    "\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Still not making sense? Let's try to explain with some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of this (following closely https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/), let's look at reading in our `stm.txt` file. This is on Moodle for those following the course, but we'll also generate a similar file here to illustrate the same points and make this more portable."

So if we just wanted to do something that involves reading the file in a linear order (for example counting the number of entries, or lines, in the file, or counting how often 123 occurs in the file), we can instead use a generator.

    "So let's try and break down how this works. The magic here is the `yield` statement. If you run a function that evaluates a yield statement, it will be interpreted as a *generator*, and a generator object will be returned. Then if used as an iterator (ie. in a for loop) the first value of the iterator will be the value after `yield`, then it will continue until `yield` is reached again and this will be the second value of the iterator. When the function stops reaching `yield` (ie. when it stops) the iteration will stop. So as a simple example of generating integers between 1 and 100 you can do:"
