It should be initialised with slope and intercept (you can call them $m$ and $b$ for short), and store those. The equation of a line will be $y = m x + b$.\n","\n","Now define a method for this class `.intersect(other)`. Here `other` will be another instance of a `Line`. The method returns the `(x, y)` point where that line intersects this one.
