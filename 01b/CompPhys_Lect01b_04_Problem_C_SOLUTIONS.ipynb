    "\n",
    "There are 4 ways you could do this that we will explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Test that each character in word 1 actually occurs in word 2.\n",
    "    2. Sort the letters in the word alphabetically and compare.\n",
    "    3. Create a complete list of all the possible strings from word 1 and then compare this list with word 2. (NOTE - only test this with short words!)\n",
    "    4. Count the number of times each character occurs in each word and then compare the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an algorithm for methods 1, 2 and 4 above. Method 3 is more advanced and has been written for you - you do not need to code it but should instead think about <b>how</b> you might code it.  How do the number of calculations performed by each method differ (give approximate answers - you don't need to count every single calculation)?"
