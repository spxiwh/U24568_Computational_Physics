    "# Problem A\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first problem we will think about how to sort an array. This seems easy but is actually a fundamental and difficult coding problem with many solutions. We will try today to think of as many solutions as we can. Sure, many of these solutions are available to you (e.g. the built-in function `sorted`), but someone had to code that up, and there are some cases where it may not be the \"optimal\" solution .... Sorting arrays is also a *really* common coding interview question so it's good to try coding sorting algorithms and will get us back into the practice of coding problem solving\n",
    "\n",
    "**PLEASE NOTE: We are well aware that you can copy and paste a sorting algorithm from the internet. You will not learn anything from doing so (and it will not help you in the assessments that will follow). Although a professional coder will use the internet often, they do so from having a lot of experience and can quickly understand and discard \"bad\" options. Please turn off the ChatGPTs/Colab-AI and avoid the search bar for this problem ... It *will* help you more.**"
