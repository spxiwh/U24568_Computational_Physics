# Lecture 8b: Signal processing 2, Manipulating data in the frequency domain

In the previous data processing class we explored the Fourier transform, how to code it up, and how to apply it. Now let's investigate some examples of data manipulation techniques that are easier, or more natural, to perform in the frequency domain.

I emphasize that *any* operation performed in the frequency domain can always be equivalently performed in the time domain. There are some subtleties to this, and reasons to sometimes use the frequency domain, or the time domain, as we will explore.
