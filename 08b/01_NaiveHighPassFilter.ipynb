    "# A na√Øve implementation of a high-pass filter\n",
    "\n",
    "A high-pass filter (see introduction slides) is one where we remove content at low frequencies (below the high-pass). This might be done if you have noise at low frequencies but signal at higher frequencies and want to extract that signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's show this with a contrived example:\n",
    "\n",
    " * We will generate a dataset that is 8 seconds long sampled 16 times a second.\n",
    " * In this dataset we will add noise with frequencies up to 1Hz, but not above it.\n",
    " * We will also add a sine wave at 4Hz, but the amplitude will be much smaller than the noise.\n",
    " \n",
    "In the time-domain the sine-wave is not visible above the low-frequency noise at all, but with a high-pass filter the signal can be easily extracted from the data because there is no overlap in the *frequency* components of the noise and the signal."
