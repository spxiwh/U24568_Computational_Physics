    "# Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's the basics of python classes. Just to recap the nomenclature here:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Class: Defines a new type of object (like a `float` or an `int` is a type of object)\n",
    " * Object or Instance: When I do `mypointlessclass_instance = MyPointlessClass()` then `mypointlessclass_instance` is an *instance* of the `MyPointlessClass` *class*\n",
    " * Methods: Are functions defined within the scope of the class, like `compute_area` within our Rectangle class above.\n",
    " * Attributes: Are values defined with the class. So things like `mypointlessclass_instance.value1` in our original example.\n",
    " * Inheritance: When a class inherits properties (methods/attributes) from another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That's largely it for classes. To see all this in a different way see the python documentation https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some neat features that we aren't going to discuss here, including:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Class properties (via getters/setters)\n",
    " * Class decorators\n",
    "\n",
    "(you can Google these if you particularly want to explore these, and I can discuss them if after doing that if things are unclear)."
